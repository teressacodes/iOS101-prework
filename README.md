## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite applications:
  1. Duolingo
     - Responsive leaderboard
     - Different app icons
     - Colorful learning roadmap
  2. Days Since
     - Multiple counter colors
     - Customizable streak counting in hours, days, weeks, months, years
     - Keeps track of streak resets 
  3. iPhone Notes app
     - Dark mode compatible
     - Ability to markup, copy/paste, attach files or create voice notes within 
     - Widget options very cool
    
My app idea: 
  Pet management app geared toward families with kids whose chores include caretaking for a dog, cat, farm animals, etc. 
  This app would provide a recording ability so that parents can know if a child has completed their chores such as feeding or walking animals. 
  It would include an option for the child to convey that food/litter is getting low and easily switch to an Amazon, Walmart, or Chewy app for the parent to reorder.
  Parents would have a specialized login that allows them to see trends of when chores are completed/totals in time frames which would assist them in distributing allowances. 
  
## Notes

Initially, I started xcode with a mac app instead of an iOS app so there were some difficulties and confusion as things were not lining up the way the prework instructions said they would.

Once I realized my mistake, the instructions made more sense and development was relatively simple.
